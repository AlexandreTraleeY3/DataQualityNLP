# DataQualityNLP
Repository containing the work on Data Quality Experiments with Encoder, Decoder and Seq2Seq models.

## Preprocessing
It consists of all the preprocessing part related to Cleaning the data, Generating the Readability Scores, and organizing the data

## Pretraining
Pretraining contains all the script about pretraining Encoder-Decoder and Seq2Seq types model. Encoder and Decoder consists of 3-Layers, while Seq2Seq consists of two Encoder and two Decoder.

## Glue - Code
This folder contains the scripts for finetuning all our models to the Glue Benchmark Data. Each task is provided.

## Requirements
Keras, Keras-NLP
